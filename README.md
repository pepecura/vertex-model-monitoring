# vertex-model-monitoring
Monitoring model monitoring jobs on Vertex AI.

Prerequisites: Building an AutoML model and setting up model monitoring service while deploying the model to an endpoint in the GUI.
This code calls the prediction API via the endpoint to generate scores on bulk data so that we can review the model monitoring results and monitor the alerts on the GUI.
